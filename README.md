# QBlock_401

The House of Alghutah [First U.S. Prefectural Caucus](https://github.com/Alghuti-Portfolio/QBlock_401/blob/22c94b22c51b604f9dbd78ecdc103381245fb598/327.pdf) official currency is the [Damascus Dollar (“DD”)](https://github.com/Alghuti-Portfolio/QBlock_401/blob/a4d0a284202951a5e95c69871cd74dfd6f46a787/50d%20Coin.pdf). For exchange outside of the 144 square foot Enclave Territory surrounded by league city (which is a city located in Texas) the US614 international exchange coin with a 50.00 face vale is accepted as an equal exchange - although it weighs less than the official Damascus Dollar.
